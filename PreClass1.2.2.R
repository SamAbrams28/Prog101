# Calling a function: name followed by parenthesis, with the arguments inside
abs(-3)
sqrt(9)

# Auto completing functions in the editor is a useful IDE feature

# str() = structure
str(3)
str("Santa Barbara")

# Another nice feature: syntax highlighting. Santa Barbara being green means R
# is seeing it as text, not a variable

# Functions can also take multiple arguments
pi
round (pi, 0)
round (pi, 5)

n_digits <- 2
round (pi, n_digits)

# Functions are a great example of encapsulation. Replacing very complex logic
# with a very simple name.

?sqrt
# ?function name brings up the functions help page in the files panel
